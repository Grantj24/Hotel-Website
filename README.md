## Summary

This is a simple booking form website for a fictitious hotel resort in Pittsburgh. This was a great project to utilize skills in HTML and CSS before moving onto more in-depth areas. This project really focused on my knowledge of html forms and input validation. This is simply a mock landing page; the only feedback the user will receive is if they do not fill out all input fields. This does not send any validation or direct to any other page. Hope you enjoy!
